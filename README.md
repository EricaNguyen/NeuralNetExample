# NeuralNetExample

This program is a neural network that reads handwritten numbers and identifies what numbers they are.

The zip file is the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). You can read its
description from the URL. This dataset consists of four files:

1. The images of the training set: 60k 28 × 28 grayscale training images, each representing a single
handwritten digit.
2. The labels of the training set: the associated 60k labels for the training images.
3. The images of the test set: 10k 28 × 28 grayscale testing images, each representing a single
handwritten digit.
4. The labels of the test set: the associated 10k labels for the testing images.
